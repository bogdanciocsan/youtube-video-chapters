Youtube chapters api extended 

Here I made an example where I took the old youtube chapters script and used it in one of my projects, where I needed the project text and time to be contained in html elements.

Dependencies: jQuery 1.9+

I used Twitter's Bootstrap for my example, but it is not necessary, you are more than welcome to use your own styling or framework of your liking.
